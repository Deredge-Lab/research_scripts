# research_scripts
This repository contains a collection of runtime and analysis scripts for various molecular biophysics applications, namely molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).

## HDX
This directory contains a collection of scripts and Jupyter notebooks to facilitate downstream HDX-MS data processing and analysis, as well as quantitative HDX predictions from modeled structural ensembles (e.g., MD simulations). 
 
## simulation-analysis
This directory contains a collection of plotting and analysis scripts for MD simulations performed in AMBER and OpenMM.

## simulation-setup
This directory contains a collection of input parameter files and submission scripts for performing MD simulations in openMM.
